      "description": "Not a single day goes by untouched by the influence of the chain. The line of raw materials, workers, and vehicles that provide consumer goods. Transfers from bus to train, train to bus on a daily commute. Habits, likenesses, and knowledge inherited over generations. The body, fuelled by the decomposition of molecular structures. These links—some seen, some felt—compose a vast, entangled web that shapes how we live, move, and relate.\n\nIn her first UK solo show, Roots and bonds, Argentinian artist Belen Santamarina explores this pervasive entanglement through her sustained engagement with the medium of human hair. Collected over six years from loved ones and strangers, disembodied tresses have made their way from scalp to studio, each strand an archive of accumulated care, labour, migration and time. Tenderly unsnarled and spun into thread, Santamarina entwines strands from disparate bodies, geographies, and timelines to produce installations that straddle textile work and sculpture, the familiar and the uncanny.\n\nAt the centre of the show is Entanglement, a suspended 30-metre-long chain meticulously crocheted from gathered hair. Each stitch conjoins with hundreds of others to form a sheet-like continuum, which is then knotted into tubular chain structures. Through this process, Santamarina constructs a bridge between the discrete and continuous, where single strands of hair and their embedded histories are woven into a densely networked form that resists disconnection. The resulting chain beckons us to consider how we are fundamentally bound to one another across bodies, borders, and systems.\n\nPresented alongside Entanglement is a series of graphite drawings, Threads, and a poem installation, Take me, which extend Santamarina’s enquiry into the relationships between material, memory, and language. These textual works treat hair not just as inert matter but as a transmitter of thought, a medium through which the energy of language and experience is carried across migratory pathways.\n\nIn Roots and bonds, chains appear as the foundational material, technique, formal expression, and overarching symbol of Santamarina’s work. They hold together molecules, communities, and networks of global exchange. They dictate how bodies are constrained and mobilised. They structure everyday experience. Through hair—a material at once intimate, estranged, and expansive—Roots and Bonds renders visible the  complex systems in which we are all entangled.\n\nText by Danni Cheng and Issra Marie Martin, 2025"

      "description": "Curated by: Federika Chaimowicz and Pilar Seivane\nPACA is delighted to present Interlaced Encounters, an exhibition featuring the work of PACA 2024 residents Emily Colipí (b. Coventry); Belén Santamarina (b. Buenos Aires); Sol Santana (b. Sao Paulo); and Constanza Pulit (b. Buenos Aires). Emerging through the rich and dynamic exchanges that took place during the August art residency in Aix-en-Provence, and hosted at Lake Space in Deptford, Interlaced Encounters reflects on conviviality as a generative force – one that weaves narratives of interconnectedness, identity, fluidity, and vulnerability. The works in the exhibition engage with the complexities and nuances of the migratory experience, and sense of belonging; reclaiming and reimagining personal and shared histories. Interlaced Encounters invites audiences into a space of shared reflection, where acts of making become acts of meaning, and where encounters—across disciplines, languages, and lived experiences—serve as catalysts for the unfolding of the self."

  "about": "Belen Santamarina\n\nb. Buenos Aires, Argentina \\\nlives in London, United Kingdom\n\nThrough the use of hair, soil, seeds and food as materials, Belen Santamarina's works explore the autobiographical and confessional to create tapestries, objects and installations. Her works engage with personal and collective migration experiences and the use of memories hybridised with science fiction and the natural world to imagine and propose alternative narratives to dominant discourses.\n\nSantamarina employs crafts historically secluded to the feminine and domestic space investigating relations of power between fine arts and craft.  \n\nHer formation is based on critical study groups and painting workshops. She exhibited her work in Argentina, Taiwan, Spain, USA and UK. In 2019, she was awarded the Honorary Mention at the Taoyuan International Art Award 2023 in Taiwan. In 2023 her work Migran-t was acquired by the Taoyuan Museum of Fine Arts, Taiwan (TMoFA).",
